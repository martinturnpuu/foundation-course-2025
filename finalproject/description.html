      <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Selected Ambient Works 85–92 is the debut album by 
  the British electronic music artist and producer Aphex Twin, whose 
  real name is Richard D. James. It was released on 9 November 1992 
  through Apollo Records, a subsidiary of the Belgian label R&S Records.
   The album consists of ambient techno James recorded on cassette as early
    as 1985, when he was 13–14 years old. It received widespread acclaim and 
    entered the Dance Albums Chart at No. 6 in December 1992.
Selected Ambient Works 85–92 is considered a classic, defining work
 of electronica. Music journalists have credited it with expanding the scope of ambient 
 music and introducing techno to fans of indie music. The website AllMusic described it as
  "a masterpiece of ambient techno".[1] Selected Ambient Works 85–92 has 
appeared on best-of lists; in 2012 the UK magazine Fact named it the greatest album of the 1990s.
Background
James began experimenting with musical instruments,
 such as his family's piano, at an early age. He later created
  music using a ZX Spectrum home computer and a sampler, and began 
  reassembling and modifying his own synthesisers.[2] James said he composed 
  ambient music the following year. In an interview with Q in 2014, James said 
  the ambient track "i" emerged from these early recordings. As a teenager, James
   gained a cult following as a DJ at the Shire Horse Inn in St Ives, Cornwall, 
   with Tom Middleton at the Bowgie Inn in Crantock,
 and on Cornish beaches.
James's first release was the 12" EP Analogue Bubblebath, 
released on Mighty Force in September 1991.[5] The EP made the playlist of Kiss FM, an influential London radio station, giving it wide exposure in the dance music scene.[6] It gained distribution in continental Europe,[7] and it was heard by Renaat Vandepapeliere, the head of R&S Records, at that time one of the leading European rave labels. James visited him in Belgium, bringing a box full of cassettes of his music. From these cassettes they picked out tracks for two records, including Selected Ambient Works 85-92</p>
